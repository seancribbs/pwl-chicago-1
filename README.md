# Packrat Parsing: a Practical Linear-Time Algorithm with Backtracking

Bryan Ford's 2002 Masters Thesis is remarkable in that it breaks
decades of compiler-construction dogma with some simple principles and
a compelling alternative to the complexity of parsing with
context-free grammars (CFGs). He reveals a forgotten class of
grammars-- top-down parsing language (TDPL), and some extensions known
as parsing-expression grammars (PEGS) -- that directly correspond to
the parsers that implement them. His primary contribution, however, is
applying modern functional programming techniques of laziness and
algebraic data structures to make TDPL/PEG parsers computationally
efficient.
